## Implementation feature engineering methods
## Basically, the methods implemented here extract patchs (subset of rows, subset of cols)
## from a data matrix, and some other feature transformation methods (e.g., tri-kmeans)
## The extracted new feature patches can be persisted in the ensemble for ensemble building
